## Steps to run code

1. Clone starter kit repo to setup environment https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit
2. Follow these directions: https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/doc/configure_via_anaconda.md
3. Activate the `carnd-term1` environment
4. Run `jupyter notebook` from root directory of this repository
5. Open the P1 notebook
6. Run all the code blocks. You can see processed images in the test_images_output directory and you can see the processed videos either embedded in the notebook or in the test_videos_output directory

## Link to Writeup

A link to the writeup is provided below. The writeup explains the image process pipeline and techniques used along with an analysis of the efficacy of the techniques used and how they could be improved.
